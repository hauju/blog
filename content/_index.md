# Oxidt

Welcome to Oxidt, my developer playground and knowledge base. As a Full Stack Software Developer with a passion for DevOps, my technical interests are broad, spanning from embedded systems to microservices. The development of new technology progresses exponentially, so I try to focus on the things that excite me. Currently i am engaged in the research and development of new posibilities based on distributed ledger technology.

For me, continuous learning is one of the most important characteristics in the field of software development and one reason for me to write this blog. It acts as a kind of a knowledge database for myself, and is maybe for one of you or your team an inspiration.

I am constantly on the lookout for new challenges and interesting contacts. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Also check out my last posts or visit me on github.
