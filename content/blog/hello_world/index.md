## The what?

As a developer, I've always sought effective ways to organize my insights and new learnings in technology. The idea of creating a central hub where I can document and share my journey and findings kept growing on me. That's why I decided to launch this blog. It's not just a platform for me to archive my knowledge, but also a space where fellow developers can explore and maybe find inspiration or solutions.

## The how?

After spending weeks reviewing different frameworks, I settled on using the static site generator [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and decided to host the blog on [Github](https://github.com/hauju) Pages. This setup has some great perks:

- Simplicity in Hosting: Setting up and maintaining the blog became a breeze, removing the usual complexities associated with web hosting.
- Cost-Effectiveness: The entire setup is free, which is perfect for developers looking to showcase their work without incurring additional costs.
- Familiar Writing Process: Zola's support for markdown meant I could write and format my posts in a way that's second nature to me, streamlining content creation.
- Version Control with Git: Integrating my blog with Git through Github Pages made version control and content updates straightforward, ensuring that my work is always backed up and easily manageable.
